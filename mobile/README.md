# TimeRide Android App

TimeRide is a social network application that allows you to record your routes and share your thoughts and photos with others. The recorded routes can be classified into three different categories: walking, driving, and biking. Each route can only be classified under one category, and if you want to switch to a different mode, you have to create a new route.
